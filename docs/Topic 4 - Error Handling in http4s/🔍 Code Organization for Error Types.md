> [!QUESTION] Where do you recommend putting a sealed trait `AppError`?

Ah, a very pertinent question! As Scala Sage, I recommend placing the sealed trait `AppError` and its associated case classes in a separate package or file, rather than within the routes class.

## ðŸ“– Theoretical Explanation: Code Organization for Error Types

- **Separation of Concerns:**
    - Error types are part of the application's domain model, not the HTTP routing logic.
    - Placing them in a separate package promotes a clear separation of concerns.
- **Reusability:**
    - Error types may be used across multiple routes or services.
    - A separate package makes them easily reusable.
- **Maintainability:**
    - Keeping error types separate improves code organization and maintainability.
    - It makes it easier to find and modify error definitions.
- **Clarity:**
    - It makes the routes classes less cluttered.

**Recommendation:**

- Create a dedicated package (e.g., `com.example.myapp.error` or just `error`) or a separate file (e.g., `AppError.scala`) to define your error types.

**Example Package Structure:**

```
src/
  main/
    scala/
      com/
        example/
          myapp/
            error/
              AppError.scala
            route/
              UserRoutes.scala
```

**Example `AppError.scala`:**

Scala

```scala
package com.example.myapp.error

import java.util.UUID
import cats.data.NonEmptyList

sealed trait AppError
case class UserNotFound(userId: UUID) extends AppError
case class InvalidUserData(errors: NonEmptyList[String]) extends AppError
```

By following this approach, you maintain a clean and organized codebase.
