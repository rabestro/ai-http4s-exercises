The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `EntityDecoder` for `Product` is not implicitly available. This is because the `Product` case class is annotated with `@JsonCodec`, but the implicit decoder is not being imported or made available in the scope.

To fix this, you need to ensure that the necessary Circe decoders are in scope. You can do this by importing the necessary Circe modules and making sure that the `Product` case class is properly annotated with `@JsonCodec`.

Here's the updated `Routes.scala` file with the necessary imports:

```scala src/main/scala/exercise3/routes/Routes.scala
package exercise3.routes

import cats.effect.IO
import io.circe.generic.JsonCodec
import io.circe.generic.auto._
import org.http4s.HttpRoutes
import org.http4s.circe.CirceEntityCodec._
import org.http4s.dsl.io._

import java.util.UUID
import scala.util.Try

object Routes {
  @JsonCodec
  final case class Product(id: UUID, name: String, price: Double)

  val routes: HttpRoutes[IO] = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
    case req@POST -> Root / "products" =>
      req.as[Product].flatMap { product =>
        Created(product)
      }
    case GET -> Root / "products" / productId =>
      IO.fromEither(Try(UUID.fromString(productId)).toEither)
        .flatMap(id => Ok(Product(id, "Some Product", 30.5)))
        .handleErrorWith(_ => BadRequest("Invalid UUID format"))
  }
}
```

In this updated code, I've added the import for `io.circe.generic.auto._`, which provides the necessary implicit decoders for the `Product` case class.

Additionally, ensure that your `build.sbt` file includes the necessary dependencies for Circe and Http4s. Your `build.sbt` file looks correct, so no changes are needed there.

With these changes, the `EntityDecoder` for `Product` should be available, and the error should be resolved.
