Excellent! Let's move on to the next topic: **JSON Handling**.

## ðŸ“– Theoretical Explanation: JSON Handling in http4s

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used format for data interchange on the web. http4s provides seamless integration with JSON libraries, allowing you to easily serialize and deserialize JSON data.

Here's a breakdown:

- **JSON Libraries:**
    - http4s supports several JSON libraries, including Circe, Argonaut, and Json4s.
    - Circe is the most commonly used and recommended library due to its type safety and performance.
- **Circe Integration:**
    - http4s provides the `http4s-circe` module, which simplifies working with Circe.
    - It provides implicit encoders and decoders for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- **Implicit Encoders and Decoders:**
    - Circe uses implicit encoders (`Encoder`) and decoders (`Decoder`) to convert Scala objects to and from JSON.
    - You can define these implicits manually or use Circe's automatic derivation capabilities.
- **Automatic Derivation:**
    - Circe's `circe-generic` module can automatically derive encoders and decoders for case classes and sealed traits.
    - This eliminates the need to write boilerplate code.
- **Media Types:**
    - When working with JSON, it's essential to set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.
    - http4s provides the `MediaType.application.json` constant for this purpose.

**Key Concepts:**

- **`Encoder[A]`:** Type class that defines how to convert a Scala object of type `A` to JSON.
- **`Decoder[A]`:** Type class that defines how to convert JSON to a Scala object of type `A`.
- **`CirceEntityCodec`:** http4s module that provides implicit encoders and decoders for Circe.
- **`circe-generic`:** Circe module that provides automatic derivation of encoders and decoders.

Do you understand these concepts, or do you have any questions before we proceed to the exercise?
