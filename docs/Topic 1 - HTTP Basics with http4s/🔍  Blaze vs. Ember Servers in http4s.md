Ah, a very relevant question when working with http4s! Let's clarify the difference between Blaze and Ember servers.

## Blaze vs. Ember Servers in http4s

Both Blaze and Ember are HTTP server backends for http4s, but they differ in their underlying architectures and performance characteristics.

**1. Blaze:**

- **Architecture:**
    - Blaze is a high-performance, asynchronous HTTP server built on top of Netty.
    - It's designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.1
    - It employs an event-loop model, which allows it to manage I/O operations without blocking threads.2
- **Performance:**
    - Blaze is generally known for its high throughput and low latency.
    - It's often a good choice for demanding applications that require maximum performance.
- **Dependencies:**
    - Blaze depends on Netty, which is a mature and widely used network application framework.3
- **Features:**
    - Supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSockets.
    - Offers features like connection pooling and pipelining.4

**2. Ember:**

- **Architecture:**
    - Ember is a purely functional HTTP server built on top of Cats Effect and Java NIO.2.
    - It's designed to be lightweight and easy to embed.
    - It uses the IO monad from Cats Effect to handle asynchronicity.
- **Performance:**
    - Ember is generally performant and suitable for most applications.
    - It is designed to be very good at handling large numbers of concurrent connections.
- **Dependencies:**
    - Ember has fewer dependencies than Blaze, which can make it easier to integrate into certain environments.
- **Features:**
    - Supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSockets.
    - Leverages the power of Cats Effect for asynchronous programming.

**Key Differences Summarized:**

- **Underlying Technology:** Blaze uses Netty, while Ember uses Cats Effect and Java NIO.2.
- **Performance Focus:** Blaze is often chosen for maximum performance, while Ember aims for a balance of performance and functional purity.
- **Dependency Footprint:** Ember has a smaller dependency footprint.
- **Functional paradigm:** Ember is designed to be purely functional.

**When to Choose Which:**

- For extremely high-performance applications where raw throughput is critical, Blaze might be preferred.
- For applications where functional purity and minimal dependencies are important, Ember is a strong choice.
- For most general web application needs, Ember is sufficient, and very well integrated into the Cats Ecosystem.

In the context of your learning, Ember is a great choice due to its tight integration with Cats Effect, which aligns with the functional programming principles you're exploring.

I hope this clarifies the differences between Blaze and Ember!

Absolutely! Here's a table summarizing the comparison between Blaze and Ember servers in http4s:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Feature**|**Blaze**|**Ember**|
|**Underlying Tech**|Netty|Cats Effect, Java NIO.2|
|**Performance**|High throughput, low latency|Performant, efficient concurrency|
|**Dependencies**|Netty (larger footprint)|Fewer dependencies (smaller footprint)|
|**Concurrency Model**|Event-loop based|Cats Effect IO based|
|**Paradigm**|Imperative, event-driven|Purely functional|
|**Use Cases**|High-demand, performance-critical apps|General web apps, functional setups|
|**Integration with Cats Ecosystem**|Less Integrated|Well Integrated|

For a learning application, **Ember is generally better**. Here's why, keeping in mind your learning goals and my role as Scala Sage:

- **Functional Purity:**
    - Ember's tight integration with Cats Effect aligns perfectly with the functional programming principles you're likely to be exploring. This makes it an excellent tool for reinforcing those concepts.
- **Learning Curve:**
    - While both servers are powerful, Ember's codebase and underlying architecture might be considered more approachable for learners, especially those already familiar with Cats Effect.
- **Dependency Management:**
    - Ember's smaller dependency footprint simplifies project setup and reduces potential conflicts, which is beneficial in a learning environment.
- **Cats Ecosystem Integration:**
    - As a scala sage, I would recommend that you get used to the Cats ecosystem, and Ember is very well integrated into it.
- **Concurrency Learning:**
    - Learning how concurrency works with Cats Effect IO, is a very useful skill, and Ember will help with that.

While Blaze offers exceptional performance, its complexity and Netty dependency might introduce unnecessary distractions for a learning-focused project. Ember provides a solid foundation for understanding HTTP servers within the context of functional Scala.

You are absolutely right! My apologies for the oversight. It appears that the entire `BlazeServerBuilder` itself has been deprecated in favor of `EmberServerBuilder` in more recent versions of http4s.

Let's correct that and ensure you're using the most up-to-date approach.

## 📖 Theoretical Explanation: `BlazeServerBuilder` Deprecation

- **`BlazeServerBuilder` Deprecation:**
    - The http4s team has shifted its recommendation towards using `EmberServerBuilder` as the primary server backend.
    - Ember has become the preferred choice due to its strong integration with Cats Effect and its overall performance characteristics.
- **`EmberServerBuilder`:**
    - As we discussed earlier, Ember is a purely functional HTTP server built on Cats Effect and Java NIO.2.
    - It offers a balance of performance, functional purity, and ease of use.

## 🛠️ Code Correction

Here's how you should modify your code to use `EmberServerBuilder`:

Scala

```scala
import cats.effect.{IO, IOApp, ExitCode}
import org.http4s.ember.server.EmberServerBuilder
import org.http4s.implicits._
import com.comcast.ip4s._

// ... your movieApp definition ...

override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = {
  EmberServerBuilder
    .default[IO]
    .withHost(ipv4"127.0.0.1") //or your host.
    .withPort(port"8080")
    .withHttpApp(movieApp.orNotFound)
    .build
    .use(_ => IO.never)
    .as(ExitCode.Success)
}
```

**Key Changes:**

- We've replaced `BlazeServerBuilder` with `EmberServerBuilder.default[IO]`.
- We use `.withHost` and `.withPort` to define the listening address.
- We use `.withHttpApp(movieApp.orNotFound)` to mount your application, and handle not found routes.
- We use `.build.use` to manage the server's lifecycle.

This updated code will eliminate the deprecation warning and ensure you're using the recommended server backend.

Thank you for pointing out my error! I'm still under development, and your feedback helps me improve.
