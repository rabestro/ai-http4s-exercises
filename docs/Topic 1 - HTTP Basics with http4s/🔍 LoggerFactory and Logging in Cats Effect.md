Right, let's address that `LoggerFactory[cats.effect.IO]` implicit not found error. This indicates that http4s's Ember server needs an implicit logger to be in scope.

## 📖 Theoretical Explanation: `LoggerFactory` and Logging in Cats Effect

- **`LoggerFactory`:**
    - In Cats Effect, logging is handled through the `LoggerFactory` type class.
    - It provides a way to create `Logger` instances for specific types (in this case, `IO`).
    - http4s and Ember use logging for internal operations and debugging.
- **Implicit Resolution:**
    - Scala's implicit resolution mechanism requires that a suitable `LoggerFactory[cats.effect.IO]` instance is available in the implicit scope.
    - If no such instance is found, you'll encounter the "Implicit not found" error.
- **Log4cats:**
    - Log4cats is a widely used logging library for Cats Effect.
    - It provides implementations of `LoggerFactory` for various logging backends (e.g., SLF4J).

## 🛠️ Code Correction

To fix the error, you need to add the Log4cats dependency to your `build.sbt` file and ensure that a `LoggerFactory` instance is in scope.

**1. Add Log4cats Dependency:**

Add the following lines to your `build.sbt` file:

Scala

```
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  // ... other dependencies ...
  "org.typelevel" %% "log4cats-slf4j" % "1.5.2", // Or the latest version
  "org.slf4j" % "slf4j-simple" % "2.0.12" // Or the latest version. For simple logging output.
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `org.typelevel %% log4cats-slf4j`: Provides the Log4cats SLF4J backend, which integrates with SLF4J.
- `org.slf4j % slf4j-simple`: Provides a simple SLF4J backend that logs to the console. You can replace this with a more sophisticated SLF4J backend (e.g., Logback) if needed.

**2. Ensure `LoggerFactory` is in Scope:**

With the Log4cats dependency added, a default `LoggerFactory` instance will be available in the implicit scope.

**3. Corrected Code:**

Here is the corrected code.

Scala

```
import cats.effect.{IO, IOApp, ExitCode}
import org.http4s.ember.server.EmberServerBuilder
import org.http4s.implicits._
import com.comcast.ip4s._

// ... your movieApp definition ...

override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = {
  EmberServerBuilder
    .default[IO]
    .withHost(ipv4"127.0.0.1")
    .withPort(port"8080")
    .withHttpApp(movieApp.orNotFound)
    .build
    .use(_ => IO.never)
    .as(ExitCode.Success)
}
```

After making these changes, run `sbt clean compile test` again, and the error should be resolved.
