Excellent! Let's begin with the first topic: **HTTP Fundamentals**.

## ðŸ“– Theoretical Explanation: HTTP Fundamentals

HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol, is the backbone of data communication on the World Wide Web. It's a simple, text-based protocol that allows clients (like web browsers) and servers to exchange information.

Here are the key aspects we'll cover:

- **Request-Response Cycle:**
    - HTTP operates on a request-response model. The client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with the requested data.
- **HTTP Methods:**
    - These define the action the client wants to perform. Common methods include:
        - **GET:** Retrieves data from the server.
        - **POST:** Sends data to the server to be processed.
        - **PUT:** Updates an existing resource on the server.
        - **DELETE:** Removes a resource from the server.
        - **PATCH:** Applies partial modifications1 to a resource.
- **HTTP Status Codes:**
    - These are three-digit codes that indicate the outcome of a request.
        - **2xx (Successful):** The request was successful. (e.g., 200 OK)
        - **4xx (Client Error):** The client made an error. (e.g., 404 Not Found)
        - **5xx (Server Error):** The server encountered an error. (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error)
- **HTTP Headers:**
    - These are key-value pairs that provide additional information about the request or response.
        - Examples: `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `Authorization`.
- **HTTP Cookies:**
    - Small pieces of data stored on the client's browser.
    - Used for session management, tracking, and personalization.

**Key takeaway:** HTTP is a text-based protocol that uses requests, responses, methods, status codes, headers, and cookies to facilitate communication between clients and servers.

Do you understand these fundamental concepts, or do you have any questions before we proceed to the practical exercises?
