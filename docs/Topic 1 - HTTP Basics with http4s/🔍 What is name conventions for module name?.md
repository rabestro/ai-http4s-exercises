In **Scala/SBT** projects, module names typically follow these naming conventions:

1. **Lowercase with hyphens (-)** – Recommended for SBT multi-module projects.

• Example: ai-http4s-exercises

• This is consistent with how many open-source Scala projects name their modules.

2. **Lowercase with underscores (_)** – Sometimes used but less common.

• Example: ai_http4s_exercises

3. **CamelCase or PascalCase** – Not commonly used for module names, but acceptable in some projects.

• Example: AiHttp4sExercises

  

**Best Practices**

• Use **lowercase letters and hyphens (-)** (as in your screenshot: ai-http4s-exercises).
• Avoid spaces and special characters.
• Be consistent with other module names in your project.
• If it’s a single-module project, keep it aligned with the repository name.

Your chosen name ai-http4s-exercises is **perfectly fine** for an SBT module.
